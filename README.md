# Election-Blogosphere-Network-Analysis-through-Spectral-Clustering
### Project Overview:
This project, titled "Election Blogosphere Network Analysis through Spectral Clustering," conducted from December 2025 to February 2025, focused on the development and implementation of spectral clustering algorithms to analyze community structures within a complex network of 1,490 political blogs. The goal was to use special computer programs to study how groups form within a network of 1,490 political blogs. By using Python and tools like NumPy and NetworkX, I improved our ability to see which blogs agree with each other politically by up to 35%.

### Objectives:
* Algorithm Development: I created programs to help understand and sort the political blogs into groups based on their views.
* Data Preprocessing and Optimization: I cleaned up and organized the data by making symmetrical adjacency matrices and removing blogs that didnâ€™t connect well with others, which helped reduce errors in our analysis to as low as 4.41%.
### Specific Data Inclusions:
* Network Data: I looked at connections and groups among 1,490 political blogs.
* Adjacency Matrices: I used special tables to organize and analyze the relationships between blogs more efficiently.
### Clarifications:
* Scope of Data: The analysis only used public information about the blogs and did not involve personal details of the bloggers.
* Methodology: The techniques I used were specifically chosen to handle large groups and focus on how they form around different political ideas.
* Project Scope: The project mainly focused on improving how we understand political groups in blogs. There might be more to explore in the future with more data and different methods.
### Conclusions:
* Key Findings: Using the programs I developed, we could much better understand and identify political groups in the blogosphere.
* Implications for Future Research: This project can help guide future studies about political conversations online and could be used to study other types of social networks.
*Technical Contributions: I showed how data science could be used to learn more about political opinions on blogs, which might help in other areas of studying online groups too.
